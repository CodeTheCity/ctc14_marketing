How many archaeologies were involved in the project?	In 2006 over 80 archaeologists, students and volunteers took part in the largest excavation to take place in Aberdeen. The Kirk of St Nicholas Uniting in Aberdeen is planning to redevelop the East Kirk as a community facility, which will be run by the non-denominational Open Space Trust (http://www.openspaceaberdeen.org.uk/).	QnA - Herald 29.3.18.docx	
How big is the excavation site?	The excavation to create a new lower level 20 x 20m in size was dug to a depth of 3.5m. Four medieval churches, nearly 900 articulated burials and 3.5 metric tonnes of disarticulated human bones were recovered. This is a           summary           of the preliminary findings as the staged post-excavation process is incomplete at time of writing.	QnA - Herald 29.3.18.docx	
What existed before the church?	Flint scatters and fish and shell processing waste indicated that this site was occupied prior to the first church being built.           A pebble surface which followed the natural slope of the site downwards to the east, may be related to the earliest church or pre-date it and two ditches may delineate boundaries of the early churchyard or slightly pre-date the structure. Steve Lancaster (then of Headland) visited the site and discussed their fills and further analysis should help with dating and interpretation.	QnA - Herald 29.3.18.docx	
When was the earliest church?	The earliest structure consisted of a semi-circular wall (or apse) enclosing a mortar floor.  This formed the east end of a church which may have been constructed in the late 11th or early 12th century. Examples have been found at Dunfermline and Coldingham Priory (both dated to around 1100) but as this type of structure is known in Europe from the time of the Roman Empire, it is likely that earlier examples were constructed in Scotland, including one excavated at the Hirsel in the Borders, which may date to the 10th century.

How many bodies are buried here?	Associated with the apse was a group of 23 burials of babies and children clustered outside the east end of this church          .           Very few of the burials intercut each other and they must therefore have been marked and probably also interred over a short period of time. All of the individuals were buried with their head to the west, although several were slightly off the E-W alignment giving the appearance that they were radiating out from the apse.

What was there before the church?	Several areas showed activity prior to the construction of the first church.A scatter of flint flakes in one area indicated that flint tools had been made or repaired on the site perhaps as long as 8000 years ago. Above this was a layer of burnt ash containing a large amount of fish bones through which features relating to the earliest stone church were cut, suggesting that processing of fish had taken place in the area.

Tell me about the antler tool?	Finds associated with the earliest phases include a fragment of antler. It had been roughly shaped in preparation for adding a handle to make a metalworking or craftworking hammer. The earliest church	QnA - article.docx	
What was the earliest part of the church?	The earliest structure excavated on this site was a semi-circular apse at the extreme west of the excavation area.	QnA - article.docx	
What was the dimensions of the earliest wall?	The semi-circular section of wall                     was 1.2m thick and evidence of one mortar floor was recorded. This wall formed the east end of a church which may have been constructed in the late 11th or early 12th century. East chuch burials Associated with the apse was a group of 20 burials of babies and children clustered outside the east end of this church          . Very few of the burials intercut one another and they must therefore have been marked and interred over a short period of time. As with nearly every burial found during this excavation, the heads of the individuals were placed in the west end of the grave with the feet at the east end, although several were slightly off the E-W alignment giving the appearance that they were radiating around the apse. Examples of possible grave markers include large stones, post-holes and a layer of mussel shells. Most of the burials were in stone or wooden coffins. The most sophisticated stone coffin was for the burial of a young child          . The neatly worked slabs had been lightly bonded together with mortar and slabs had been placed over the top forming a cover. The cover stones had been dislodged during the burial of an adolescent next to it, but enough remained in place to be able to determine how the coffin would have looked. Several other burials took place within stone-lined cists whilst some had pillow stones around the head and in one case the feet. Traces of wooden coffins with iron nails and fittings surviving were also recorded          . One of the burials had been disturbed during the construction of the mid 12th-century east end and the bones had been re-interred at the bottom of the wall foundation. Another series of burials, possibly associated with the apsidal church, was a series of E-W deep burials cut into the natural sands and gravels and through an earlier pebble path. The bones of these skeletons were poorly preserved but several graves contained coarse textile remains under the bodies which may have been the remains of a blanket placed under the bodies or the remains of a shroud which has only survived on the underside of the body. Several examples had the remains of twigs placed at the side of the body; one possible explanation has been raised following the discovery of two scallop shells next to the head of one of these burials. Such shells were sold in the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in north-west Spain and would have been attached to the hat or other clothing of a pilgrim. The person who owned this shell may have set off on a pilgrimage from Aberdeen by boat for the 4 day journey to the south of England and then on another 4 day boat journey to the north of Spain or west coast of France. There the pilgrim would pick up the The Way of St James and walk on to Santiago. These shells are rarely found in Scotland: one was found in the mouth of the skeleton of a man, buried in the 14th century, during an excavation at the Benedictine monastery on the Isle of May, in the Firth of Forth. The twigs might be the remnants of, or the representation of, the staff carried by a pilgrim; further analysis of samples of this wood may help with the interpretation of these finds. At least three other burials in this area had taken place within hollowed out logs                      and a sample of wood from one example has produced a radiocarbon date from the early 11th century. Samples from bone will be tested (over the next few months) with the hope of getting more accurate dates. Four of these burials had been disturbed by the construction of the mid 12thcentury church. In the photograph                     the wall can be seen in the centre with the disturbed graves at the top right. At least one of these burials had taken place within the previous 40 years (Paul Duffy pers comm), and it is likely that when the wall cut through it, ligaments still held the bones of the body together. The body was then 'folded' over out of the way of the new wall, and when excavated appeared to be a 'pile' of bones with wood and textile in between the layers of bone. One of these individuals was interred with a lead alloy cross suspended on a copper alloy chain around the neck; this survived intact even though there was later disturbance of the grave. A pebble path which followed the natural slope of the site, from the burials around the apse downwards to the east, may be related to this early church. Two ditches, one in the extreme northwest of the excavation area                     and one running north-south across the east end of the excavation, were cut before or during this phase. They may delineate boundaries of the early churchyard. Further analysis of the fills of these ditches should help with dating and with their interpretation. The mid 12th-century east end The mid 12th-century east end was constructed over and east of the earlier apse; it was 5.6m wide and 12.8m of its length was excavated. It was built on substantial foundations 1.1-1.3m wide; several courses of ashlar masonry survived as well as one section of plastered wall. It had two buttresses on the east facing gable end but other such features were lost when the east end of this building was reconstructed in the late 12th to early 13th century. Evidence for the completion of this phase of the church is slight but several burials align with the walls of this church, which was reused in the later 12th-century. A stone coffin, possibly associated with this 12th-century east end, had been disturbed and sealed by the later 12th-century building work (see below). Only the foot end survived and there were no human remains           in situ          . Consolidating the 12th-century east end In the late 12th century, the east end gable wall was reconstructed. This wall survived to a height of 1m internally and three courses of ashlar masonry survived on the exterior. There is evidence that parts of the north and south walls were also rebuilt at this time: it is possible that structural instability caused damage to much of the east end which had to be rebuilt. On each of the east corners, pilaster buttresses           (below, left)           date this wall to the late 12th century (Richard Fawcett pers comm). 10 Two large buttresses on the east gable were badly damaged by 15th-century building operations but traces of ashlar facings survived. One buttress survived on the south wall           (left)           and traces of a parallel one were found on the north wall. The ‘sacristy’ A building 4m wide was added on to the north side of the 12th-century church, not during the initial building phase, although the walls were tied in to the existing walls rather than being butted against them. Evidence for the length of the building was lost when the north wall of the 15thcentury east end or choir demolished part of this building, which may have had two storeys. On the lower floor, two steps were excavated suggesting that this area was entered from the graveyard. During the demolition of this building very little material had been reused and there were substantial layers of roofing stone, worked stones, iron fittings and window glass and a small number of floor tiles; no floors were recorded           in situ           however. Within the fill were several copper alloy objects including book fittings and chain link           (right, top)           as well as sherds of pottery                     discarded in the corners of the building. These pots were freshly broken and had probably been in use in the building: it is possible that they were used for a religious purpose, or that the ground floor room was used for domestic or light industrial purposes, possibly for a short while before its demolition in the 15th century. This building may have included a sacristy where sacred vessels such as chalices and vestments used in the mass, service books, and other valuable items such as processional crosses were stored and prepared for use. The upper floor was probably accessed from the church itself, although the doorway was lost during 15th-century building operations. Burials in the 13th-14th century graveyard The graveyard associated with the late 12th-century east end was excavated around the south, east and in a small portion of the north side adjacent to the sacristy. Of the burials dating to this period, some were in coffins whilst others were placed in shrouds. The burials had been disturbed by the construction of the 15thcentury church. Associated with one of these burials were four fragments from a limestone sarcophagus which had been reused, possibly as a grave marker. The fragments of the sarcophagus included the shaped section which would have been used to place the head and shoulder of an important or wealthy person. The word 'sarcophagus' comes from the Greek words for 'flesh' and 'eating' and tends to be used for specially constructed stone containers for burial. Early Greek coffins were said to have been made from a special kind of rock that consumed the flesh of the corpse inside a type of limestone. The burials to the east of the later 12thcentury east end were well preserved, although the feet of several had been cut during the construction of the 15th-century choir. The relationship of the two buildings can be seen on the photograph; the 15th-century wall can be seen on the left. One burial appeared to have been marked near the head          . The burials included the skeleton of a woman with an unborn baby, both presumably having died in childbirth. The finds A skeleton with a scallop shell beside the left leg                     suggested the individual had been buried with a long bag (or scrip) commonly carried by pilgrims; remains of the bag itself had not survived. Pilgrim shells from Compostela usually have two or four holes for attachment to a bag, clothing or hat. Other finds associated with the 12th century churches include window glass, floor tiles and several hundred fragments of worked stone. These will all be studied to gain as full a picture as possible of this building. An ear scoop                     was found in one of the burials associated with the later 12thcentury church; it would have formed part of a medieval toiletry set and was one of several examples found on this excavation. Several bone items were recovered: bone was used to make combs, dice, gaming pieces and other intricately decorated items, because it was an easy material to work. Preparations for the 15th-century building works Prior to and during the building of the 15th-century choir, a large volume of soil was brought in to level up the area. The soil included large quantities of unworked flint nodules, pottery and animal bones, and may have come from several sources - the flint possibly from the beach, imported with beach sand and the pottery and animal bones from a medieval domestic area in the vicinity of the church. This substantial deposit had protected the church remains and burials underneath, allowing for the excellent preservation of the underlying deposits. The 15th-century church This excavation has shown that the building of the early 19th-century East Kirk utilised the walls and foundations of the 15th-century east end, or choir. The eastern boundary of the excavation was the 1.2m thick west wall of St Mary's Chapel, possibly built in the early 15th century. A sloping corridor had been constructed adjacent, and attached to, the south wall of the 15th-century choir to allow access through the west wall of St Mary's Chapel. The corridor had been constructed of large stones covered with a mortar floor. The wall of the corridor had been plastered and a window                     inserted into the external wall allowing natural light to enter the corridor from the south. It appears that although this corridor was very well built, it went out of use after a short time. Very few examples of this type of access to lower areas of churches are known and a corridor of this sort would have taken up a large amount of room within the church. It may, therefore have been a 'construction' corridor, one which was in use during the building of the choir in the 15th century and then dismantled. At the north side of the choir a flight of stairs was uncovered within a small vaulted area           (far right)          . The stairway probably went out of use at the Reformation when a vaulted roof                     was built creating a division between St Mary's and the choir. A series of pier or pillar bases, dug through the walls of the 12th-century choir, would have supported the weight of the roof and walls of the 15th-century church. The pillar bases were over 2m in diameter and were constructed of stones so large that the construction company working with the archaeologists on this project had serious problems removing them from the site. Their foundations were mainly bonded with pink clay and were surrounded by two linear sleeper walls                     constructed of large and small stones bonded with both pink clay and cream mortar. Paving survived on the upper surface of these walls as well as the impressions of several of the piers. No pier fragments were found in situ but many fragments were found on the excavation. Hundreds of fragments of carved stone from the 15th-century east end were found. One carved stone face           (below)           had been reused in the manufacture of a 19th-century wall: it is likely that this was part of a ceiling boss from the 15th-century church. Several masons' marks were recorded including a star and an M with a tail. The internal fittings Two or three altar bases were uncovered on the north side of the south aisle. These were constructed of mortared stones and at least one had a burial immediately in front of it. In the north aisle, foundations for a possible wooden loft had been constructed out of stacks of mortared reused gravestones. Burials within the 15th-centurychurch Burials took place within the 15th-century church from its completion until the late 17th to early 18th century. A date for the latest burial should be determined from radiocarbon dating. Family burial areas Areas of multiple burials may suggest family groups. Two of these areas contained six individuals: further analysis of the human bones may include the extraction of DNA to allow archaeologists to determine whether and how these individuals were related. One of the family areas had at least two burials with coins which have dated them. One of the later burials had four coins placed onto the lid of the coffin. They had corroded onto the wood and remained in place to be excavated. The latest coin was dated to 1691, whilst one found in one of the earlier burials dated to the 1590s, suggesting six members of the same family were buried within this burial 'vault' over a period of about 100 years. An area on the south side of the choir had been set aside for the burial of small children, including some very small preterm infants. One old adult female had been buried adjacent to them with her head to the east, the opposite orientation from most of the children           (below, right)          . In one example there was evidence that an arrangement of flowers had been placed within the coffin before burial. Seeds and insects were recorded in an area around the spine           (right and far right)          . Some burials had been cut through earlier walls including that of an elderly woman which had cut through the late 12th-century east end gable wall. She had been buried with her legs bent and one of her hands under her pelvis. In general, arms were placed at the side of the body, crossed at the pelvis or over the chest           (right)          . The legs were usually laid side by side but occasional ones were different: one had its legs crossed at the ankle. The upper part of a skeleton of a middle-aged male indicated that he had died from blade wounds in battle. The skull had 6 blade wounds including major injuries on the back and the side of the head as well as one wound which removed the left half of the upper jaw including the teeth           (below)          . A 16-19 year old male had died from syphilis probably in the 16th or 17th century period. He had contracted it during his early teens and it was so serious that bony changes had taken place on the skull and long bones           (above, right)          . One middle-aged female suffered from rickets, or osteomalacia, a softening or weakening of the bones caused by lack of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is often historically associated with inadequate exposure to sunlight of people who worked long hours indoors in polluted 19th-century industrial cities, although this person was almost certainly buried at a much earlier period than that, probably in the 15th or 16th-century. Lack of dairy products in the diet can also lead to vitamin D deficiency. This woman was buried with a lead religious badge decorated with an image of Our Lady of Pity (or pieta), the image of the Virgin Mary with the body of Christ supported on her knees. It may have been that the woman buried in this grave bought this badge on a pilgrimage or it may have been made in Aberdeen, as St Mary's Chapel was dedicated to our Lady of Pity. It is possible that she carried the badge as a medicinal token to cure her of what ailed her, or as a symbol of piety. In one of the later burials the skull of a man had distinctive wear on pairs of front teeth suggesting that a clay pipe had been held between his teeth over long periods of time           (right, top left)          . Soil associated with late burials included one disarticulated skull which had its top sawn clean off, presumably for postmortem examination, perhaps in the 17th or 18th-century. A mandible (lower jaw) with a gold wire wrapped around the front lower incisors is the only evidence of dental work found during the excavation           (right, top right)          . The two 'supporting' teeth in question are completely rotten, though, so one can't help thinking that the individual might have been better off without them. One woman had suffered from scoliosis, a disease in which the spine curves into an 'S'-shape           (right, centre)          . The cause of this illness is uncertain, but this woman must have suffered from it since childhood. Jewellery and personal items Very few items of jewellery have been found in burials but these included a heart-shaped brooch which was found over the heart of one individual           (right, bottom right)           and a small number of brooches found in situ. Two gold earrings were found loose in soil and have not been dated yet: one was a plain ring with a cuff and one probable earring is in the form of a spiral. A large number of pins were recovered, mainly in copper alloy. These would have been used for pinning clothing and shrouds. Several examples of spectacle frames and lenses were excavated as well as many beads made from bone, glass, ceramic and jet          . Clothing Several examples of clothing fragments were recovered. At least three hats included one complete well-preserved example. In several burials, lace and other fragments of cloth survived. Analysis should reveal their original colours. Two 19th-century churches Foundation trenches for walls to support the floors and pews of the 1874 East Kirk were very substantial. They had cut through many burials and the larger bones had often been carefully reinterred. Areas of burning on the internal face of the south wall and in soil layers, probably came from the 1874 fire, showing that the walls were retained but the roof and internal fittings were rebuilt.
